# Optimization-of-Shank-link-of-quadruped-legged-robot
This project was part of the work I did during my research internship at Stoch Lab, RBCCPS, IISc under [Professor Shishir N. Y. Kolathaya](http://www.shishirny.com/). I analyzed the shank using Ansys Structural and reduced its weight by 16% using TPMS structures like the gyroid. Mass reduction is an excellent way to have reasonable control in robotics as it also reduces the inertia of legs. I tried to reduce mass by using biomimicry, inserting some nature-inspired structures in the shank's central portion, and covering it with thick plates. Butterfly wings have inspired this design with beams enclosing gyroids. Butterfly wings require a high strength-to-weight ratio, so we decided to mimic them.

**Conclusion**
<br>
Though the central part made of gyroids reduces weight by 30g, which is optimized by 16%, it will have greater manufacturing complexity and cost more than the original one. Currently, this design has been kept for future reference. There is quite scope for further improvements like using graded gyroids, which have variable cell sizes of gyroids. They have better energy absorption capacity than uniform ones, which is quite interesting. Also, the usage of compliant materials like Shape Memory Alloys (SMAs) can be looked into
